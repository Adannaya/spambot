Cabbages and greens,
Broccoli and beans,
Cauliflower and roasted potatoes,
Taste so good to me!
2 Apricots and plums,
Ripened in the sun,
Oranges and yellow bananas,
Good for everyone!
CHORUS It?s another Harvest Festival
When we bring our fruit and vegetables,
?Cause we want to share the best of all
The good things that we?ve been given.
It?s another opportunity,
To be grateful for the food we eat,
With a samba celebration to
Say ?Thank you? to God the Father.
3 Golden corn and wheat,
Oats and sugar beet,
Fluffy rice and tasty spaghetti,
Wonderful to eat!
4 Coffee, cocoa, tea,
Growing naturally,
Herbal plants and all kinds of spices,
Very nice indeed!
CHORUS
MIDDLE 8 Thank you for the harvest,
Thank you for your goodness,
For all of the fruit and vegetables
And the wonderful things that grow.
(Repeat)
Repeat verses 1 then 2 (with Middle 8)
CHORUS
God the Father.
