# spambot
Code for making a spambot with a console menu

When the script starts, it will allow you to choose which text to spam, then you have 5 seconds to get your cursor in place.
If you need to stop the script, move your mouse to the top-left corner of the screen to activate PyAutoGUI's failsafe.

PyAutoGUI needs to be installed for this to work, which can easily be done with `pip install pyautogui` from the command line or Windows Command Prompt.
